# Homomorphic polynomial evaluation using Galois structure and applications to BFV bootstrapping

This is the code associated to our paper of the same title, by Hiroki Okada, Rachel Player and Simon Pohmann [eprint/2023/1304](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1304.pdf), to be published at Asiacrypt 2023.

The code is modern C++ using the MS Seal library. Currently, we only have build files for Visual Studio (Windows), but it shouldn't be too hard to make the code run on Linux. Some comments in the code are written in Tex, so consider using https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1305558.VsTeXCommentsExtension2022 with Visual Studio.
